# Crop_Fertilization
The Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops and fertilizers based on soil and environmental parameters. By leveraging Decision Tree Classifier, this system predicts the best crop for a given set of conditions and recommends optimal fertilizer usage, promoting sustainable and data-driven agriculture.
Features

Crop Recommendation: Predicts the best crop based on soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

Fertilizer Recommendation: Suggests the optimal fertilizer based on soil condition and crop type.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier for accurate predictions.

Data Preprocessing: Includes feature scaling using StandardScaler and dataset cleaning.

Visualization: Provides insights into data through graphs and plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
